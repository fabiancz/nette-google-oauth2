This is fork, so I can't add it to Packagist.

## Instalation

Insert repositories section to composer.json in your project:

```neon
"repositories": [
      {
          "type": "vcs",
          "url": "https://github.com/fabiancz/nette-google-oauth2"
      }
  ],
```

Add require:

```neon
"fabiancz/nette-google-oauth2": "@dev"
```
